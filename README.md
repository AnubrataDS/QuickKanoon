## An android app to help everyone understand the Indian laws easily

Most of the citizens of India are not well-aware of their rights and laws.

This makes them rely solely on lawyers in judicial matters , and often duped/cheated in the name of law.

This app aims to make citizens of India self-sufficient in this matter and educate them about the laws , and also act as a handy quick-reference guide to the laws applicable in common situations .

Currently working features :
* Tag-based search engine to search from a large collection of laws 
* Easy to find laws applicable in most common day-to-day scenarios
* Clear explanation of the laws in simple english 
* Bookmark laws for easy access

Future plans :
* NLP-based searching for better experience
* Regional translations 
* Expanding the collection of laws
* Try to go global if project gains enough traction
* Make a similar web app so every device can use the service.
